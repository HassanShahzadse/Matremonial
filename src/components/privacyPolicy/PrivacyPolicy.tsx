                What is the Concept of Cookies?
              </h1>
              Cookies are elements present in web browser software that enable
              web servers to identify the specific computer used to visit a
              particular website. They are minor bits of information saved on
              the user's computer by their web browser. The main purpose of
              cookies is to keep a tab on the data a user viewed on a single web
              page, which subsequently simplifies user interactions with the
              website going forward. Furthermore, cookies expedite the user's
              activities on linked web pages, enabling smooth navigation from
              one page to another, as well as successful completion of online
              transactions. Cookies are designed to enhance your online presence
              and personalize your online experience.

                How is User Information Collected from Cookies Utilized?
              </h1>
              We deploy browser software tools such as cookies, along with web
              server logs, to acquire key details about our website users’
              browsing patterns, which helps us to perpetually refine our
              website and cater efficiently to our customers. The acquired
              information aids us in designing and structuring our web pages to
              be as user-friendly as possible. We also regularly update our
              website in accordance with the needs and preferences of our
              customers and potential patrons. Additionally, cookies provide us
              with essential business and technical insights. Information stored
              in cookies enables us to track the routes followed by users
              arriving at our website, from one page to another. Web server logs
              help us in keeping count of the number of individuals visiting our
              website and assess our website's visitor capacity. We refrain from
              using these technologies to capture personal details like email
              addresses. However, we do use them to target online banner
              advertisements or similar responses.
